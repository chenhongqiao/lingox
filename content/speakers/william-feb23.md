Meet William, one of the amazing educational consultants here at LingoX and the first speaker in our new monthly career exploration series!

William Choi received his BS with honors in Neuroscience and double majored in Philosophy at the Johns Hopkins University. Since his undergraduate years, William has conducted research relating to various neuroethical issues, such as a quality-of-life study on caregivers of individuals with a rare neurological disorder and a capstone project on stakeholders' perspectives on acceptable outcomes after acquired brain injury. As a rising student doctor, he is interested in studying diverse philosophical approaches to death and dying, and developing patient-centered decision-making models for individuals with neuropsychiatric conditions. He recently completed his Master of Bioethics degree at Harvard, and will be attending the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University this upcoming fall.
