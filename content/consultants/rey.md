Rey will be studying sociology with a focus on its applications in healthcare at UC Berkeley in the fall. During high school, they did a lot of acting and speech & debate, and became nationally recognized in both by senior year! On top of this, Rey has worked with various professors to conduct research on topics like the decriminalization of illicit substances and its links to the prison industrial complex. When Reyâ€™s not pursuing my academic interests, they love to knit and embroider gifts for friends!
